# github for the SARWAI research project


Install:
1. Pull remote repository to local repository
2. Run the cartographer_install.sh found in /crash_the_husky/resources
   NOTE:
   This will take a while, so sit back and relax, DO NOT PAUSE THE INSTALL
   If an error occurs read it and google it. A common issue is the ninja install
   and requires the installation of the ninja package for catkin_ws. If you have the 
   most recent version of ros installed ninja is already present.
3. Run the launch file using the command "roslaunch crash_the_husky crash_the_husky.launch"
4. Enjoy
